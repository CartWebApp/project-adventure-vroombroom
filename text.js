    "The morning sun had risen over the hills by the time you had finished practicing the forms with your brother's staff.",
    "It had been a year since he was dragged off to war without even a shoe to his name.",
    "You still think of it as his, holding the staff up to the light.",
    "Watching the runes inscribed on the wood shine. The runes did not shine like this towards him.",
    "He was right to hide this weapon.",
    "The way it was forged made it look as if it belonged to a legendary hero.",
    "A horn blares in the distance, the alarm ringing out overhead, jolting you out of your stupor.",
    "The thunderous sound of dozens of horses galloping in the distance envelops the air, shaking the ground.",
    "Over the hill, knights - foreign knights - race across the hillside, gunning towards the village, the village you call home.",
    "The defenders were too late, as a few of the knights had made it inside before the others were shut out." ,
    " The clashing sounds of metal only grew louder as the gate opened, and the remaining knights flooded in, massacring the last remains of what had protected the village and its occupants." , 
    "Running down the hill, you feel the earth beneath you tremble with each frantic step." , 
    "A rock juts from the ground, your foot catches it, making your world tilt as you tumble down the rest of the way." , 
    "Rising to your feet, you ignore the aching pain as you sprint through the scattered bodies. Panting, you reach your home, throwing open the door. The door slams open as you stagger into your family home. " ,
    "“Mom? Dad?” you yell out, only for your voice to be swallowed by the silence" , 
    "A low moan reverberated throughout the home." , 
    "“Son..” a voice calls out weakly" , 
    "You make  your way through the once-perfect home. Destroyed walls, broken floors and marks cover the entire path as you walk. Each step you could hear the slow ragged breathing, entering the family room you see a body." , 
    "Your father lies on the floor, Bloody and battered. his ragged breaths come slowly, each one harder than the last." , 
    "“Son..” His voice hoarse, Turning his head slowly to you" , 
    "“D-dad..!” You lift his head, holding it close to you, fearing letting go would bring his demise." , 
    "“You.. have to—” He coughs, blood spilling onto his chest." , 
    "“You have to run.. Please, escape.” " , 
    "Tears escape your eyes, blurring your vision as you clutch on to your fathers broken form. " ,
    "“N-no dad.. I can’t leave you” your voice cracks, panic rising throughout your body" , 
    "Suddenly you hear footsteps, the reality of what is happening hits you. You need to make a choice" ,

    "Run",
    "Stay and Fight" ,
    "Laying your father gently, you stand making your way to the back exit of what was once your home." , 
    "Swinging it open you run, you run till you can’t hear the horn anymore, the sounds of pain that had been echoing throughout the village." ,
    "You end up in the forest, massive trees surround you, their leaves blocking the incoming sunlight." ,
    " Looking around you see nothing but darkness, the soft sounds of nature echo through the area. " ,
    "Taking a deep breath, you calm yourself down. Firstly you need to plan, make a shelter, find food and or help." ,
    "The cool, damp air that slatured through the forest had been heavy and moist." ,
    "The calm sounds of nature had been interrupted, the sounds of hooves override the sounds of nature. They were making their way towards you." ,
    "Hearing the intense, rumbling of the incoming knights you decide to run." ,
    "Sprinting across the dirt path you make your way through the forest as the thumping got louder and only closer, on your way you spotted a horse alone and all saddled up you thought that was odd but you needed a way to escape." ,
    "Without a second thought as soon as the horse was in grabbing distance you hopped onto the horse." ,
    "Grabbing the reins you prepare to take off to get away from the enemy and be able to live." ,
    "A shiver rang through your body as you felt the cold metal of a blade rest against the back of your neck." ,
    "“Alright, I don't even wanna know just get off and don’t reach for that stick on your back,”  an unknown male voice said." ,
    "Another blade appeared in front of you, the tip of it poking at your throat." ,
    " Swallowing deeply you let go of the reins and put your hands up in surrender." ,
    "WIth that you slowly made your way off the horse as your feet hit the ground." ,
    " You are grabbed and restrained, one of the men grabs the staff off your back and throws it to your left." ,
    "“Hey..! what are you doing!?” you barked at them" ,
    "“What does it look like? I'm tying you up?” " ,
    "With one last tug he was done as he rose up from his knee, admiring his finished work " ,
    "“L-listen, the Aiel they're here!” You shouted, wiggling your wrist trying to break free from the restraints that had united both of your hands. " ,
    "The man’s eyes widened, then he snorted “You expect me to believe. That they’re here?” " ,
    "You glared at him, infuriated he took your warning as a joke, Before you could retort an arrow whizzed by barely missing the man's head." ,
    "Before the man can react a volley of a dozen arrows shot through the brush" ,
    "As the arrows flew one struck him in the shoulder, quickly he pulled the shield from his back and put it in front of him catching two more arrows." ,
    "“AMBUSH” The man shouted," ,
    "Without a second thought you began to roll, turning on your side you rolled away from the incoming battle hiding behind some trees and shrubs." ,
    "The loud clashes of metal disrupted the serene sounds that had once engulfed this area." ,
    "You struggled trying to remove the restraints, holding out your hands you grind the rope against a branch." ,
    "With one final tug you break through the rope freeing your hands. As soon as you did that an axe came swinging down on you." ,
    " You barely manage to roll out of the way, the sharp blade missing your side by mere inches. The force of the swing creates a gust of wind that sends leaves scattering into the air." ,
    "You scramble to your feet, heart racing, and glance over your shoulder. The battle rages behind you, but in the thick of the trees, you have a moment to breathe." ,
